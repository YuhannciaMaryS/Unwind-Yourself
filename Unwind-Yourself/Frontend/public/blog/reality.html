      A boy named vijay seems to be in restless because his mother was appointed at hospital as she had severe heart attack but no one at the hospital gave a proper information about his mother condition. So he got angry and went to see the specialist doctor to ask about his mother condition but the doctor replied that his mother was in very critical stage and it was very difficult to make her alive . As soon as vijay heard this he started crying loudly, at that time a voice cut cut cut came from another side and so that day shoot was came to end. The director told vijay "You are very good at acting especially in mother sentimental scenes" So vijay replied "You are the one who made me to act like this so all credits only deserves you" The director also acted some additional emotional scene towards the mother character to make that scene look so realistic. And the time to take the next shoot came moreover the director showed him how to act if he lost his mother. Such acting of the director shocked others and everyone in the crowd including vijay told " one who take care very well of their mother only can act like this " Then the shooting was continued. During the shoot a voice from assistant director interrupted the shoot so the director was furious and asked "why are you disturbed the perfect emotional scene?" The assistant director told "I have got a call from old aged home where you have sent your mother was passed away due to severe heart attack".Then vijay and every one in the crowd realized movie is just a acting we people only fell into it.
