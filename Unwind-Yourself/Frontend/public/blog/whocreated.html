    <h1>WHO CREATED?</h1>

    <p>A patient had been waiting to see the doctor and asked the nurse, Carley, when the doctor would arrive. Carley replied politely that the doctor was occupied with other healthcare activities but would arrive on time. The doctor soon came and visited the patients.</p>

    <p>Carley was the doctor’s best friend and confidante. They shared everything. On another day, the same patient returned, and again the doctor wasn’t available. Carley explained that the doctor was also running an orphanage, blood donation centers, and homes, ensuring everything functioned well. When the patient asked if there was anything more, she giggled and replied, “Who knows?”</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Hema, a dedicated theologian, was secretly researching the origin of the caste system. She worked with Karan, who asked why she chose this path. Hema replied that it was because of her family, though she didn’t like talking about them. She believed anyone could ask about your caste, but no one questioned where caste itself came from.</p>

    <p>Karan, recommended by his sister—Hema’s childhood friend—was assisting Hema in the secretive research. Meanwhile, the patient at the hospital tried to learn more about Carley. Initially reluctant, she eventually opened up and explained that her hospital coworkers were like her family and that she came here for her best friend, Divya.</p>

    <p>Divya and Carley were like cousins but were actually just best friends. In college, Divya fell in love with Prem, and their relationship was supported by all, including Carley. However, their families disapproved because of caste. They married secretly, and Carley signed as a witness. When the families found out, Divya’s family killed Prem to prevent “caste mixing.” Carley has been caring for Divya ever since.</p>

    <p>While Carley was telling the patient about Divya, another patient entered with head injuries. Carley thought he looked familiar but couldn’t place him. He said his name was Raj and had lost a lot of blood in an accident. He requested immediate blood donation, but the doctor wasn’t available.</p>

    <p>Just as Carley picked up her phone to call the doctor, Hema entered the hospital and yelled not to donate blood. Raj looked at her in confusion—Hema was his daughter. Raj asked who she was to make such a decision. Carley then revealed: “She is Dr. Divya, whose husband you killed for caste.”</p>

    <p>Hema calmly added, “If we donate blood, your caste will be mixed. So we cannot provide you blood.”</p>
