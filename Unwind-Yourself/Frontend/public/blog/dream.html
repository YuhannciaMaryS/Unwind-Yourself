    <h1>The Real Dream</h1>
    <p>
      There is a scientist who is interested in searching for lucid dreams. One day, he challenged himself by saying that he could control his lucid dreams and live in them whenever he wants to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, he deeply fell into his research to prove himself as the best scientist because he always wanted reputation from others. As he didn't invent anything, he wanted to show that he could live an imaginary life with real physical feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the time is nearly midnight on August 2, 2020. He feels sleepy, but he received a notification from his research system, but he didn't take it seriously, clicked the notification, and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he started to see something different and experience a new kind of life because everything was unbelievable. Then he thought his research was working out and realized he was in a lucid dream. And so it looked real. Then he touched and felt everything in that place as he was enjoying his dream; he didn't want to come back from his dream to the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his imaginary life, he met some new people who are all so different, and he also saw some advertisements on the cloud for new types of flying bikes and cars without batteries or diesel. So the scientist didn't want to end his dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw his watch to see the time; the time was 10 p.m. on August 2. Then, after some time, there formed a crowd. Everyone rushed there, including the scientist, but he didn't know what was happening there, so he asked one of the people in the crowd, and he replied, "Aliens are coming to attack us. Leave this place quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said to himself, "I'm not going to see any aliens in my real life; at least I got a chance to see them in my imaginary life. Thank God!" Then he watched some aliens, but the attack happened so violently that everyone cried so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the scientist thought that it was time to end his dream; otherwise, everyone would be attacked by aliens. So he tried to wake up from his dream with his research system, but nothing happened. Again and again, he tried, but he failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked at his watch; the time was 11 p.m. on August 3, and he saw the year and was shocked because it was 2090. Then he realized that his imaginary life is a real life, that his lucid dream research went wrong, and that he got trapped in 2090 by time travel.
