    It's Monday morning, 9 ''o'clock. The place was so hectic that everyone rushed to go to work as there were no traffic police. That place became heavy traffic. Usually everyone reaches their workplace within half an hour, but this time it's already been an hour late. One of the men in that traffic shouted at the previous vehicle to move forward towards the opposite side because he had an important meeting with his boss, and if he went late, he would face a lot of problems. Like this, many people were urged to go for their work, and another man from the opposite side raised a voice to move backward. The vehicles on both sides over and over yelled to move forward, but no one was ready to move backward because of this lot of people stuck in the traffic. Finally, when the traffic police arrived, he cleared the road.
    
     After 2 weeks, Keerthi, a student who recently completed her schooling, gets ready to join her new college. The college is nearly 5 kilometers away from that traffic road. Keerthi is a very kind and straight-forward girl. As it was her first day at the college, she introduced herself and her father, but when the staff asked about her mother, she told them that she had no mother. She then chose her place and talked with everyone. Keerthi came up with many dreams and expectations, and so she interacted with everyone easily. One of her classmates,  Madhu, is a quite introverted student who doesn't talk much to others, but Keerthi voluntarily went to Madhu and asked about her, but Madhu didn't feel comfortable speaking with others, like this everyday went. Madhu is the kind of girl who concentrates only on her studies and focuses on quickly getting a job. Every day she comes to college and studies, and then she goes. She is also a rank-holder student. Even though she is a topper, she doesn't mingle with anyone; she always spends her time alone. 
    
    Vijay Madhu's classmate liked Madhu, so he always tries to speak with Madhu, but Madhu always refuses to talk to him and doesn't even care about him. So one day, like this, Vijay told his friend that he was going to speak with her, but their friends replied, "Every time you are telling this, but she doesn't even look at you, this time is also going to happen like this." Hearing this, Vijay decided to talk with Madhu, but as usual, she went like nothing happened and continued to study; she didn't even warn him. Seeing the activities of Madhu, Keerthi again came to Madhu and asked her, "Why don't you speak with anyone?" Madhu told Keerthi that she came only to study and to place quickly in a top company. But Keerthi didn't like this kind of behavior, and she thought that there may be some problem, which Madhu couldn't tell. So Keerthi tried to mingle with Madhu, and so she became close to her. Now a days, Madhu speaks only to Keerthi, but Keerthi talks to everyone, so Madhu is afraid of losing Keerthi, so she didn't let Keerthi talk much to others, and also, Keerthi doesn't take it seriously.
    
     The next day their class received a circular about a sudden increase in their academic fees, so everyone was confused about how to pay the fees and decided to talk with staff about this sudden raise in fees, but their staff didn't respond well, so they planned to meet their principal. All the students hesitated to take responsibility for representing this problem in front of the principal, so they discussed it among themselves, but no one came forward to represent them all. But when Keerthi heard this, she immediately took responsibility and met the principal. She explained the situation of all the students, but the principal informed her that only because of the chairman's rules had the fee changed. So Keerthi decided to strike against unfair fees, and she also got support from all the students, but when Keerthi called Madhu, she refused to come, and she also said, "However, everyone is going to pay the same amount, and what should I do?" Keerthi didn't expect this kind of answer from Madhu, so she didn't call her for the strike, but she alone led the strike, and as a result, the fee was reduced. Madhu congratulated Keerthi and then asked, "Why are you taking so much responsibility?" But Keerthi didn't reply to her, and she didn't feel happy for that behavior of Madhu. 
    
    Later, one of Keerthi's friends, Kavi, called Keerthi to ask for help from her senior riya; she ragged Kavi by insisting on doing her work. When Kavi talked back to Riya, she threatened Kavi, so Kavi called Madhu to help her, but at that time also, Madhu didn't come to support Kavi and concentrated on studying. Therefore, Keerthi's anger towards Madhu was raised, and she asked Madhu about this incident, but Madhu calmly said, "That's not my business, and what should I do for that?" Keerthi again got upset with Madhu's activity, then she went with Kavi to solve her problem, and Keerthi also asked Kavi for forgiveness for Madhu's behavior, but Kavi said, "I know Madhu since my childhood, and she wouldn't behave like this those days, but now something may have happened to her, so try to find it, dear." So Keerthi tried to talk with Madhu over and over. When she was going to ask about Madhu's problem, Madhu received a phone call from their parents, but Madhu shouted at them by yelling, "One day you went late for your office meeting and got suspended due to heavy traffic. So Why are you forcing me to go for a job  quickly?" Then Madhu ended the call. Listening to this, Keerthi didn't say anything to her because she realized that because of her parents pressure, she was studying, so she convinced her by saying, "Instead of your dad stuck in traffic and losing the job, why did your dad take the responsibility to clear the traffic?" However, Madhu didn't listen to her and simply said, "That is my dad's opinion; that's not my business, and what should I do for that?" Keerthi was disappointed. 
    
    Seeing Keerthi, Kavi asked her what happened. Keerthi expressed " if madhu's father or anyone came forward to clear the traffic by taking responsibility now my mother will be alive from that massive heart attack by admitting her to the hospital at correct time " and keerthi continued that " Atleast if I tried to clear the traffic without expecting he or she will come there could be atleast 50% of chance to save my mother that's why I'm taking responsibility immediately rather than regretting later" then kavi convinced her by encouraging keerthi's attitude and behavior while kavi and keerthi was talking madhu interrupted them by asking help to keerthi that Vijay was waiting outside the college to threaten madhu for accepting his proposal otherwise he warned her that he will create a big issues by lying about her in bad manner so madhu came to keerthi for her help but this time keerthi simply said " That's not my business" and questioned what should I do and why should I do ?
