  <h1>The Unsolved</h1>

  <p>A case that has remained unsolved for two years is now assigned to a new inspector <span class="important">Rahu</span>, a man known for his persistence and unwavering dedication to justice. Coming from a poor background, Rahu endured hardships that shaped his resolve.</p>

  <p>Five years ago, he worked as a driver to support his ailing mother after his father's death. Despite low income, he trained every spare moment to become a police officer. Today, he stands tall as an inspector, a role he earned with blood, sweat, and sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Rahu receives a call from his childhood friend <span class="important">Fayas</span>, now a doctor working abroad. They share everything. But before Rahu could explain the case, Fayas ended the call, wishing him luck.</p>

  <h2>The Case</h2>
  <p>An apparent road accident where a woman named <span class="important">Mala</span> was hit by a speeding bike. She was rushed to the hospital by ambulance and declared dead within minutes. However, her post-mortem revealed a <span class="important">neck slash</span> and only <span class="important">one kidney</span>. Murder or accident?</p>

  <p>Rahu forms a team ‚Äî himself, <span class="important">Sai</span>, and <span class="important">Rishi</span>. They investigate the CCTV footage and the hospital. The footage shows no robbery or snatching. The hospital staff remain unhelpful.</p>

  <p>Then comes a twist ‚Äî Sai questions how the ambulance reached within 5 minutes when the hospital is 5 km away. They question the driver, but find nothing suspicious. Sai begins to lose hope.</p>

  <h2>The Theory</h2>
  <p>Rahu proposes a theory ‚Äî <span class="important">what if there was another ambulance</span> involved? One that picked up Mala first, did something on the way, then transferred her to the next ambulance for hospital admission?</p>

  <p>The neck slash? A decoy to make it look like a robbery. The missing kidney? Possibly stolen in the window between the two ambulances. A chilling and intelligent setup to turn suspicion in every direction.</p>

  <div class="quote">"What if the killer wanted us to believe it was the hospital's fault? What if the chain-snatch angle was a distraction?"</div>

  <h2>The Reveal</h2>
  <p>Suddenly, Fayas enters the room, asking about Rahu‚Äôs mother, who he had operated on two years ago. He says something shocking: <span class="important">"Two years ago, I saw you as an ambulance driver. Now you‚Äôre an inspector."</span></p>

  <div class="ending">
    <p>And just like that, the case unravels. Rahu was unknowingly involved in Mala‚Äôs transport. Someone used the ambulance switch tactic, and now, he‚Äôs solving the very case that shadowed his past.</p>
    <p><span class="important">The case was solved‚Ä¶ and the unsolved, finally had an answer.</span></p>
